## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment
```bash
# Ensure you're on the correct branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Check for any uncommitted changes
git status

# Review all modified files
git diff
```

### 2. Build Verification
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Run TypeScript check
npm run type-check

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Run tests
npm run test

# Create production build

# Verify build output
ls -la .next
```

### 3. Testing in Staging
```bash
# Deploy to staging environment

curl https://staging.afritechbridge.com/health

# Manual testing checklist:
# [ ] Open lesson with YouTube video
# [ ] Verify progress tracking works
# [ ] Complete video to 90%
# [ ] Verify lesson completion
# [ ] Check next lesson unlocks
# [ ] Test Vimeo video
# [ ] Test direct video file
# [ ] Test on mobile device
```

### 4. Production Deployment
```bash
# Create deployment tag
git tag -a v1.0.0-video-tracking -m "Video tracking feature"
git push origin v1.0.0-video-tracking

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:production

# Verify production deployment
curl https://afritechbridge.com/health
```

### 5. Post-Deployment Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor error logs
tail -f /var/log/afritec-bridge/error.log

# Monitor API calls

## üêõ Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: YouTube video not loading
**Symptoms**: Blank player, no progress tracking
**Diagnosis**:
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log('YT API:', window.YT);
console.log('Player:', youtubePlayerRef.current);
```
**Solution**:
1. Check network connectivity
2. Verify YouTube API not blocked
3. Check console for CORS errors
4. Ensure `enablejsapi=1` in embed URL

#### Issue: Progress not updating
**Symptoms**: Progress bar stuck at 0%
**Diagnosis**:
```javascript
// In ContentRichPreview component
console.log('Progress:', videoProgress);
console.log('Current Time:', currentTime);
console.log('Duration:', videoDuration);
```
**Solution**:
1. Verify player initialization
2. Check interval is running
3. Ensure video duration detected
4. Verify callbacks are wired correctly

#### Issue: Lesson not completing at 90%
**Symptoms**: Progress reaches 90% but no completion
**Diagnosis**:
```javascript
// In handleVideoComplete
console.log('Video Completed:', videoCompleted);
console.log('Lesson ID:', currentLesson?.id);
console.log('Module ID:', currentModuleId);
```
**Solution**:
1. Check `onVideoComplete` callback passed correctly
2. Verify API endpoint accessible
3. Check backend logs for errors
4. Ensure lesson/module IDs valid

#### Issue: Next lesson not unlocking
**Symptoms**: Completion successful but next lesson locked
**Diagnosis**:
```javascript
// In navigation logic
console.log('Can Navigate Next:', canNavigateNext);
console.log('Video Completed:', videoCompleted);
console.log('Lesson Completed:', isLessonCompleted);
```
**Solution**:
1. Verify backend updated completion status
2. Check module progression rules
3. Ensure frontend state synced
4. Verify navigation gating logic
