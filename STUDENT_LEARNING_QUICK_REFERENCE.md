# Student Learning Page Improvements - Quick Reference

## Summary of Changes

I've analyzed how instructors create courses and assignments in `frontend/src/app/instructor/` and significantly improved the student learning interface to match these capabilities.

## New Components Created

### 1. ContentRichPreview.tsx
**Location:** `frontend/src/app/student/learn/[id]/components/ContentRichPreview.tsx`

Renders rich content based on instructor-defined types:
- **Text**: HTML formatted content with styling
- **Video**: YouTube, Vimeo, or direct MP4 playback
- **PDF**: Inline viewer with download options
- **Mixed**: Combination of all types in structured sections

**Key Features:**
- Content type badges
- Duration indicators
- Learning objectives display
- Responsive media players

### 2. QuizAttemptTracker.tsx
**Location:** `frontend/src/app/student/learn/[id]/components/QuizAttemptTracker.tsx`

Full-featured quiz interface matching instructor quiz creation:
- Pre-quiz view with details and instructions
- Question navigation and progress tracking
- Timer with time limits
- Answer selection interface
- Visual question navigator
- Submission confirmation

**Supported Features:**
- Multiple question types
- Time limits
- Max attempts
- Question/answer shuffling

### 3. AssignmentPanel.tsx
**Location:** `frontend/src/app/student/learn/[id]/components/AssignmentPanel.tsx`

Comprehensive assignment submission interface:
- Text response editor
- File upload with validation
- Combined text + file submission
- Due date warnings
- File type/size validation
- Instructions and requirements display

**Validation:**
- File type checking (respects `allowed_file_types`)
- File size limits (respects `max_file_size_mb`)
- Due date status indicators

## Updated Components

**Location:** `frontend/src/app/student/learn/[id]/components/LessonContent.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Integrated `ContentRichPreview` for rich media
- Integrated `QuizAttemptTracker` for interactive quizzes

## Integration Guide

### Using ContentRichPreview
```tsx
<ContentRichPreview
  lesson={{
    title: lesson.title,
    content_type: lesson.content_type || 'text',
    content_data: lesson.content_data,
    description: lesson.description,
    learning_objectives: lesson.learning_objectives,
    duration_minutes: lesson.duration_minutes
  }}
/>
```

### Using QuizAttemptTracker
```tsx
<QuizAttemptTracker
  quiz={lessonQuiz}
  onStartQuiz={() => trackEvent('quiz_started')}
  onSubmitQuiz={(answers) => submitQuizApi(quizId, answers)}
/>
```

### Using AssignmentPanel
```tsx
<AssignmentPanel
  assignment={assignment}
  onSubmit={(submission) => submitAssignmentApi(assignmentId, submission)}
/>
```

## API Integration TODO

The following API methods need to be implemented:

```typescript
// Quiz submission
POST /api/v1/student/quizzes/{quizId}/submit
Body: { answers: Record<number, string> }

// Assignment submission
POST /api/v1/student/assignments/{assignmentId}/submit
Body: FormData with text_response and/or files
```
