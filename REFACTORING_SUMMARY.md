## Benefits of this Refactoring:

1. **Better Code Organization**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to one feature don't affect others
3. **Improved Reusability**: Components can be reused in other parts of the application
4. **Better Testing**: Each component/util/hook can be tested independently
5. **Reduced File Size**: Main page.tsx reduced from ~1400 lines to manageable size
6. **Type Safety**: Centralized type definitions improve type checking
7. **Better Performance**: Smaller components optimize re-renders

## Next Steps:

The main `page.tsx` file needs final cleanup to:
- Remove all the old duplicate code
- Use only the extracted components
- Keep only orchestration logic
- Import and use the extracted utilities
