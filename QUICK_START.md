* Debugger is active!
```

### 2. Start Frontend (Terminal 2)
```bash
cd /home/desire/My_Project/AB/afritec_bridge_lms/frontend
npm run dev
```

**Expected Output:**
```
â–² Next.js 14.x.x

- ready in X.Xs
```

### 3. Test Achievement System

**Open Browser:**

## Test API Endpoints

### Test with curl:

# Get leaderboards
curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/achievements/leaderboards

# Get quests
curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/achievements/quests
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Backend Not Running" message
**Solution:** Start the backend server (see step 1 above)

### Issue: Frontend shows errors
**Solution:** 
1. Clear browser cache: Ctrl+Shift+R
2. Restart frontend: `Ctrl+C` then `npm run dev`

### Issue: 404 on achievement endpoints
**Solution:** Check that achievement routes are registered in `backend/main.py`

### Issue: Empty achievements list
**Solution:** Run initialization again:
```bash
cd /home/desire/My_Project/AB/afritec_bridge_lms
source backend/venv/bin/activate
python init_achievements.py
```
