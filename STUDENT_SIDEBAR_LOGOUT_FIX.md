# Student Sidebar Logout Button Fix

## Problem
The logout button in the student sidebar was not working because it was implemented as a navigation link to `/dashboard/logout` instead of calling the actual logout function from the AuthContext.

## Root Cause
In the `StudentSidebar.tsx` component, the logout was configured as a navigation item:
```tsx
{ href: '/dashboard/logout', label: 'Logout', icon: <UserCircle size={iconSize} /> }
```

This would attempt to navigate to a route that doesn't exist, rather than executing the logout functionality.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Import the logout function
Updated the import to include the `logout` function from the `useAuth` hook:
```tsx
const { user, logout } = useAuth();
```

### 2. Added LogOut icon
Added the `LogOut` icon to the imports:
```tsx
import { BookOpen, GraduationCap, LayoutDashboard, UserCircle, Briefcase, Bookmark, LogOut } from 'lucide-react';
```

### 3. Removed logout from navigation items
Removed the logout item from the `navItems` array and moved Forums to the proper position.

### 4. Created dedicated logout button
Added a separate logout section with a proper button that calls the logout function:
```tsx
{/* Logout Section */}
<div className="mt-auto pt-4">
  <button
    onClick={logout}
    className="w-full flex items-center gap-3 px-3 py-2.5 rounded-lg text-sm font-medium transition-colors hover:bg-red-500/10 hover:text-red-400 text-gray-300 border border-gray-700 hover:border-red-400/30"
  >
    <LogOut size={iconSize} className="text-gray-400" />
    Sign Out
  </button>
</div>
```

## Files Modified

## Benefits of the Fix
1. **Functional logout**: The button now properly calls the logout function
2. **Consistent with other sidebars**: Matches the implementation pattern used in InstructorSidebar
3. **Better UX**: Clear visual distinction for the logout button with hover effects
4. **Proper state management**: Logout function properly clears authentication state and redirects

## Testing
- The logout button should now properly log out the user and redirect to the login page
- Authentication state should be cleared from localStorage
- The backend logout endpoint will be called to invalidate the JWT token

## Visual Changes
- Logout button is now at the bottom of the sidebar with a distinct red accent on hover
- Uses the LogOut icon for better visual clarity
- Separated from navigation items to indicate it's a system action
