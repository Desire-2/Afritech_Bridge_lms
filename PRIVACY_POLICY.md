## 8. AI-Powered Processing & Automated Decision-Making

### 8.1 AI Fair Selection System

AfriTech Bridge uses an artificial intelligence scoring system to evaluate course applications on the LMS. This system:

- **Processes:** Application form responses, stated experience, location, and motivation data.
- **Produces:** An objective score to assist the admissions process.
- **Purpose:** To provide fair and unbiased assessment, reducing human subjectivity and giving equal opportunity to learners from all backgrounds.

This constitutes **automated decision-making** that may significantly affect access to our training programmes.

### 8.2 Your Rights on Automated Decisions

You have the right to:

- **Request human review** of any AI-generated decision that materially affects your application outcome.
- **Request an explanation** of the general factors considered in the AI scoring process.
- **Contest** a decision you believe is incorrect.

To exercise these rights, contact support@afritechopportunities.com with the subject line **"AI Decision Review Request"** and your application reference.

### 8.3 Other Automated Processing

We use automated tools for:

- Fraud detection and suspicious activity flagging (see AML Policy).
- Session management and authentication (JWT token validation).
- Platform performance optimisation.

These processes do not create legal or similarly significant effects on users without human review.
