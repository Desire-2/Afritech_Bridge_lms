## Current Navigation Structure (StudentSidebar)

The StudentSidebar component currently uses these paths:
```tsx
const navItems = [
  { href: '/dashboard', label: 'Overview' },
  { href: '/mylearning', label: 'My Learning' },
  { href: '/myprogress', label: 'My Progress' },
  { href: '/courses', label: 'Browse Courses' },
  { href: '/opportunities', label: 'Opportunities' },
  { href: '/forums', label: 'Forums' },
  { href: '/dashboard/profile', label: 'My Profile' },
  { href: '/dashboard/settings', label: 'Settings' },
  { href: '/dashboard/help', label: 'Help & Support' }
];
```

## File References Found

### 1. Component Imports (using @/components/student/)
- StudentSidebar: Referenced in 8+ layout files
- StudentDashboard: Used in main student page
- CertificateGallery: Used in certificates page
- QuizInterface: Used in quiz pages
- EnhancedLearningInterface: Used in learning pages
- ProgressAnalytics: Used in progress page
- CourseBrowser: Used in courses page
- LearningInterface: Used in course learning

### 2. Service Imports (using @/services/)
- StudentService: Used in dashboard, courses, mylearning
- StudentApiService: Used extensively across components
- student.service: Used for enrollment and progress data

### 3. Navigation Links (/student/ prefix)
Current usage throughout codebase:
```
/student/courses - Browse courses
/student/learning - Learning overview
/student/learning/[id] - Course learning
/student/progress - Progress analytics
/student/certificates - Certificate gallery
/student/opportunities - Opportunities
/student/dashboard - Main dashboard (via layout redirect)
/student/forums - Forums
/student/quiz/[id] - Quiz interface
/student/courses/[id] - Course details
/student/courses/myprogress - Progress overview
/student/courses/myprogress/[id] - Course progress
/student/enrollment/apply/[id] - Course enrollment
```

### 4. Router References
- router.replace(`/student/learning/${courseId}`) in learning/courses redirect
- window.location.href assignments to /student/ paths

### 5. Backend API Endpoints
All using `/api/v1/student/` prefix:
- `/api/v1/student/dashboard/`
- `/api/v1/student/learning/`
- `/api/v1/student/enrollment/`
- `/api/v1/student/progress/`
- `/api/v1/student/assessment/`
- `/api/v1/student/certificate/`

## Issues Identified

### 1. Path Inconsistency
Current student pages are under `/student/` but navigation links point to root paths:
- Navigation: `/dashboard` vs File: `/student/dashboard`
- Navigation: `/courses` vs File: `/student/courses`
- Navigation: `/mylearning` vs File: `/student/mylearning`

### 2. Duplicate/Conflicting Routes
- Both `/student/learning` and `/student/mylearning` exist
- `/student/courses/myprogress` vs `/student/progress`
- Multiple quiz interfaces at different paths

### 3. Missing Route Handlers
- Navigation links point to routes that don't exist in app directory
- Some sidebar links may result in 404s

## Required Changes

### Option 1: Move files to match navigation (Recommended)
Move all student pages from `/app/student/` to root level pages that match the navigation:
- `/app/student/dashboard/` → `/app/dashboard/`
- `/app/student/courses/` → `/app/courses/`
- `/app/student/mylearning/` → `/app/mylearning/`
- etc.

### Option 2: Update navigation to match current structure
Update StudentSidebar and all navigation links to use `/student/` prefix:
- `/dashboard` → `/student/dashboard`
- `/courses` → `/student/courses`
- etc.

## Files Requiring Updates

### Navigation Components
- `/frontend/src/components/student/StudentSidebar.tsx`
- `/frontend/src/components/common/Header.tsx`
- Various Link components throughout the codebase

### Service Files
- `/frontend/src/services/studentApi.ts` (frontend API calls)
- `/frontend/src/services/student.service.ts`

### Component Files with Hard-coded Links
- Multiple components in `/frontend/src/components/student/`
- Layout files with navigation

### Configuration Files
- Next.js route validation files
- TypeScript build configurations

## Recommendation

**Option 1 is recommended**: Move the student pages to match the existing navigation structure. This requires:

1. Moving files from `/app/student/*` to `/app/*`
2. Updating imports in layout files
3. Preserving the authentication guards
4. Testing all navigation flows

This approach maintains consistency with the existing navigation and avoids breaking changes to the API or component structure.
